Created by Evyatar (script) and Barak (Tests).

As always, feel free to improve the tester and to share it. 

Installation:

We have 3 tests:

	a. This test is not auto test!! you have to check the results yourself (easy).

2. runAllTests - main test. 
	a. Test's all Sjava files in the folder 'tester_files/Tests'.
	b. You can add as match Sjava Files as you want (to any folder or new folder).
	c. All results are being written to the file 'tester_files/user_output.txt'. use it!
	d. It takes about 2 minutes.
	
3. runSpecificTests_optional
	a. Can be used to test specific Sjava files.
	b. Easier to debug.
	c. To use - place Sjava files under 'tester_files/Tests/specificTests'.
	d. You can copy to the folder any Sjava file, or add new ones.
