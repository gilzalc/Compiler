Packages and java files of Ex6:

oop.ex6.blocks:
This package is composed of an abstract class of a block of codes (AKA scope), with the concrete blocks of the
S-java program,that are the Global, Method, IfWhile that serves for both if condition or a while loop, and a
general ScopeException that represents the exceptions of the blocks.

oop.ex6.regexs:
A package that centers all of the methods that uses regular expressions for manipulating text,and also includes
a special inherited classes, MethodRegex and VariableRegex for special use in method or variable lines,
respectively.

oop.ex6.parsers: Package that holds the parsers for all of the scopes,and one parser (FileParser) that parses
all over the file, creates the different parser of the program, and gives them provides them their code lines.
Each one of them (excluding the FileParser inherit from the super and abstract class "Parser", that has the
general methods that each parser uses. This package also holds various Exception files, that all are sub
classes of a general ParserException class.


oop.ex6.main:
Package with the main class of the program, Sjavac, that receives a file as an argument, and prints the
corresponding return value. also has an IllegalSFile exception class, that refers to any exceptions the
program has found during the compiling process (excluding IO exceptions).

Classes:
Keywords: An abstract class that represents the special keywords that are defined in the s-Java language.it is
composed of two enums, one for the Variable types, and one (General) for the others.
Manager: Manages the flow of the parsing process.
Sreader: A wrapper class for the Buffered reader object
Variable: Represents a specific variable object of the s-Java program.

=============================
We have divided the program's tasks, for a small units of responsibility, according to the modularity
principles. sometimes we used some hierarchy in the classes, especially in
the Parsers and the blocks package of classes, because of the similarity of the parsers and blocks, and the
fact  that some extends others in a way, so we could minimize the code duplication, and
implement the Open/close principle, because the code now can be extended to another type of a scope of
program lines very easily and intuitively.

In addition, we chose to design the Global scope and the global scope parser making a use of the singletons
design pattern, so we can make the program full-safe in the future, since the fact that each program has just
one global scope.

Since we know all of them during the compiling process, the keywords is represented in the code as two enums,
one for the Variable types, and another one for the  other general keyword,both placed in an abstract class
that has a method, which returns a list of all of the String representations of the words. this way we managed
to separate the objects from the rest of the code, and make an addition of another variable type or other
keyword very facile.Working with enums made the program very open-closed and singled-choice, since extending
the program in many regards, only means expanding the related enum, as we described at the answers to question
part.

We also kept on our mind the Encapsulation and the single-Responsibility principle, so we created a manager
class that is responsibility is to manage the parsing process of the scopes, and the Regex classes, which only
deals with the complexity of manipulating Strings using regular expressions, using java util's Matcher and
Pattern class. In this way we followed with the principles of the modular design -
we decomposes the problem into a number of less complex sub-problems- which is a modular decomposability,
and then connected them back at the manager and the sjavac class main method. Of course we are not obligating
the extension of the code to follow this pattern, according to the importance of the composability - cause we
produced a software elements which may be freely combined with each other to produce new systems.
the design of the exceeptions mechansim is explained on the answers section

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================

Since we do not care about the contents of a valid comment line, or a general string of spaces(of course some
spaces matters and we checked them separately), we decided to first parse the file and get rid of all of the
comment lines and redundant and meaningless white-spaces. Afterwards we've sent the lines for a a fileParser
class, which divides it to the different scopes of the program.

Since the global scope has a unique and different characterises, like the fact that its lines order are
irrelevant, we've first parsed all over him to create the variables object. we understood that we dont need
to store its concrete value, just some other characteristics, such as whether it was initialized, or whther
the variable was declared as a final one, and of course the type of it. we chose to store the var. object in
an hashmap of the relevant scope, since the names are uniques and can served as the keys for the variable
itself.Then we have created the methods objects, cause before starting to parse the inner method lines,
we add to "recognize" all of the method names and its invoking requirements, so we can determine wether the
code is legal.

=============================
=    Answers to questions   =
=============================

6.1) How you handled s-Java code errors in this exercise, and why you chose to do so?

We chose to implement a number of different exceptions in the different packages for different reasons, that
all causes
the sjava file  to be is invalid, in any case where we detected illegal behavior of the code we called an
appropriate exception for the specific error, and we added an error message describing the type of problem.
All of the exceptions we implemented inherit from the IleagalSFile exception, that we have implemented in the
main package. We chose to deal with the exceptions this way, because that in this way, way we could
characterize each problem in the file in a unique way and print a message to the user explaining what exactly
is wrong with the file. In addition, we chose to implement all the exceptions so that they would inherit from
the same class, because that each method was required to throw at most one exception, and catch only one
exception in the main method.

6.2)

a) How would you modify your code to add new types of variables (e.g., float)?

very easily - since we are guided by the single choice principle, we just had to add to the Keywords.type enum
an object that fits the "float" string, and to update the Keywords.Type enum,to possess an additional type,which
is a FLOAT for example, with its matching regex and assignments rules in the isMatching method of the enum.
now we can say we understood well the beauty within the single choice principle.

b)
Different methods’ types:

we would send the first word to a factory of the method types, that supports just the legal method types,
and stores the method type as a data member of the method object, and then when encountering a return line
expression, we would send the returned value to the method we already add, that checks if a given value is
from a specific type.

– Using methods of standard java (i.e System.out.println):

we would store them automatically as a methods of the global scope, because we know all of them at the start
of the program , that's because they are fixed and could be invoked from anywhere in the file.


6.3) Please describe two of the main regular expressions you used in your code.

Using the Regex method "CommentOrEmpty",At the beginning of our program run in the FileParser class, we filtered
out the entire line that we had to ignore and we did not add them to the list of lines we went through later
in the program.

Using the Regex method "checkMethodCall", we checked if a valid call to the method is made in the line we are
checking, if a legal call to the method was indeed made then the method returns the name of the called method
and its parameters using Matcher's "capturing groups" skill, and named the groups in an appropriate name,for a
better understandability of the code.
