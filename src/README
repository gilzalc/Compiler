The README instructions from previous exercises apply here as well. Please describe your design
and focus on non-trivial decisions you made. The README file should also include answers
to the questions from Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.
6.1: report in your README file
how you handled s-Java code errors in this exercise, and why you chose to do so.
6.2: You are required to specify your design, as well as your thinking process and the alternatives you
     ruled out, in your README file.
     In addition, you should address the following points in your README file:
     • How would you modify your code to add new types of variables (e.g., float)?
     • Below are four features your program currently does not support. Please select two of
     them, and describe which modifications/extensions you would have to make in your code
     in order to support them. Please briefly describe which classes you would add to your code,
     which methods you would add to existing classes, and which classes you would modify. You
     are not required to implement these features.
     – Classes.
     10
     – Different methods’ types (i.e int foo()) .
     – Using methods of standart java (i.e System.out.println).
     – Inheritage of files (just like class inheritage, so virtual functions can appear, and a
     sub-file may use a method from a parent file).
6.3:
In your README file, please describe two of the main regular expressions you
used in your code.
